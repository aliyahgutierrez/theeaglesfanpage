            <h1>BIO</h1>
        <br>
            <p>The Eagles were unquestionably the biggest mainstream American rock band to emerge in the 1970s. Not only did they sell more records and concert tickets than their peers -- Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) and Hotel California are two of the biggest-selling albums of all time -- but they captured the shifting zeitgeist of the '70s, riding the country-rock hippie hangover at the end of the '60s until it reached the slick, expensive, and expansive pop/rock of Southern California in the late '70s. Co-leaders Don Henley and Glenn Frey didn't seem like brothers, but rather partners who made a pact to lead a coolly professional outfit designed to maximize their impact. </p>
